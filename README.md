how we can boost up cpu design
Today, network on chip is one of the most important patterns proposed in the field of chip design to optimize chip area, power consumption, and also increase control and communication between chips. In this article, different common buffer schemes are described for their use in on-chip networks. The purpose of these schemes is to show the correcting process of using buffers to reduce the amount of buffer required by the router and thus reduce the power consumption and chip area. In the first suggested scheme, there are two virtual channels for each physical channel, each of which has its own buffer space and uses the physical channel in a shared manner so that the maximum use of the queue space is done. This is to perform the routing and transmission process at the same time. Second, the design of the router has generally become a central routing, where the transfer decision between all router ports occurs at the same time, and thus the amount of buffer consumption is reduced by half. In your third, a shortcut path has been added to the previous plan, which increases the efficiency, and in the end, these last two techniques are compared according to their simulation results, and it is concluded that the increase in efficiency and throughput is achieved even by reducing the number of buffers. has been
